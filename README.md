# SphereTSP

Java-based interactive visualization tool used to solve the traveling salesman problem (TSP) on a 3D sphere. 
Employs a genetic algorithm-based solution for TSP where all points are on the surface of a sphere.

The SphereTSP code was developed by researchers at the University of Ege in Bornova-Izmir, Turkey
and published in the following paper:

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228710887_Genetic_Algorithm_Based_Solution_for_TSP_on_a_Sphere

The software was published in binary format and hosted as a Java applet here:

http://yzgrafik.ege.edu.tr/~ugur/SphereTSP/

At the time of this writing, applets are no longer supported by most modern browsers so it was
difficult to see how the SphereTSP actually works. So I downloaded the class files and decompiled
the source so I can do my own build. The software found in this repository is an artifact of that
effort.
